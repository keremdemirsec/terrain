# Terrain Generator with Coloring

This project includes a Processing application that generates a 3D terrain using the Perlin noise algorithm. Additionally, it features coloring based on the height values of the terrain.

## Requirements

Follow the steps below to set up the development environment for this project:

1. Download and install [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/).
2. Download the project to your computer or copy it from the directory containing this README file.
3. Open the Processing IDE and run the project.

## Project Description

- The `terrain.pde` file contains the Processing application that generates the 3D terrain.
- The height values of the terrain are determined using the Perlin noise algorithm.
- The coloring of the terrain is applied automatically based on the height values.

## Usage

1. Open the project with the Processing IDE.
2. Run the `terrain.pde` file.
3. Explore the generated 3D terrain. Coloring is automatically applied based on the height values.
4. Enjoy and customize the code for further enhancements.
